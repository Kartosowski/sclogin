# SCLOGIN

This is a Velocity plugin I created for handling automatic login and basic player logging.

# Why I Open-Sourced This

I decided to stop working on this project, so I open-sourced it to let others learn from it or build upon it. It might be useful for anyone looking to implement a simple login system on a Minecraft Velocity proxy.

Feel free to explore, use, or modify it as you wish!
